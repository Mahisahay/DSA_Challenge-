You may encounter many defeats, but you must not be defeated....

With this thought, i completed the second week of my DSA challenge.
In this week i have done the topics- Arrays, binary search, different sorting algorithms and praticed many famous problems of these topics.
Honing my problem-solving skills and enhancing my understanding of efficient coding practices.

In this week, i also held the badge of --> The top 15 coders on Code studio in arrays.
I participated in biweekly coding contest on leetcode.
However, i wasn't able to craked the problem but atleast got the idea of the level of questions asked in the contest.
That's all for this week, will keep on updating my journey. #keep_smashing #coding #DSAchallenge
