Hello everyone, 
i have completed one-week of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) challenge! This week has been a journey filled with exploration, learning, and growth in the realm of computer science fundamentals.
#Accomplishments-  
Throughout this week, i delved into basic topics and a variety of DSA questions on coding platform like leetcode. Each day brought a new set of problems and concepts to explore and hands on practice from multiple free resources.
#Celebrating_My_Achievements- 
Taking a moment to celebrate my achievement, no matter how big or small it is. Whether i solved every problem with precision or encountered hurdles along the way, completing this challenge is a testament to my dedication and perseverance.
#what's_next?
As i reflect on my journey through this DSA challenge, consider what lies ahead. Now i'm planning to go ahead with further topics, start participating in coding contests, and the possibilities are endless. #keep_smashing
